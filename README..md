Step 1: Run main.py 
Step 2: Have proper lighting around the webcam or main camera 
Step 3: Slowly move the red cloth in front of the webcam 


Results: As sooon as the webcam starts it will capture an image after two seconds and then you can hide anything with a red cloth by placing it over the object as a mask 

Note: The cloak/ cloth used should be bright red or a light shade of red
      No red object should be present in the background as it will hamper the videocapture
